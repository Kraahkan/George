					<description><![CDATA[New Kids on the Block is my favourite pop-band of 90s. NKOTB had so many hit songs! The ones I remember are &#039;Tonight&#039;, &#039;Baby, I Believe In You&#039; and their hit &#039;Step By Step&#039;. These are real masterpieces, not fake like today! And it is sooo good they have a tour in 2019! So I&#039;m going to attend their concert this year. The tour dates is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://newkidsontheblocktour2019.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;New Kids on the Block concerts&lt;/a&gt;. Click on it and maybe we can even visit one of the concerts together!]]></description>
